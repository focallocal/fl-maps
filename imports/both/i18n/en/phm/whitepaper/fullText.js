**Movement Background**
Founder Andy worked for the past 7 years building and running a non-profit volunteer community aiming to change the world by bringing people together to give their time voluntarily to solve global issues, on a local scale. Theorising that in many situations charities are massively limited in scale, and an unstoppable wave of change could be created if it became a normal habit to give a few hours a week on resolving issues in our local communities, using the most effective ideas collected from other community members around the world (local action for global change).  Creating a proactive and empowered global community who want to meet and adapt these projects to fit their culture and then replicate them to target change to societal issues like homelessness, isolation, human connection, etc,  

The past 7 years felt like swimming upstream. Many amazing people came in and did fabulous altruistic work, most were shortly pulled away by other commitments and general modern life pressures preventing momentum from really building - especially in London, the founding city. The struggle was against a world where good intentions are in constant strife against heavy pressure on our free time. 

Blockchain is a chance to incentivise that action, allowing the modern world to refocus their attention on local issues important to a healthy society, which have been marginalised under our constantly pressured, GDP based societies. Modern technology also allows us to share effective ideas in a far more intelligent way than ever before, and achieve a much greater impact than previously possible.

## 1.2. 

**The Focallocal Community**
Set up as a non-profit ‘charitable organisation’ in the UK, the Focallocal Community has been established since 2012. It is an open volunteer community for people wanting to take action and make the world they live in a happier, safer and friendlier place through creating public happiness activities and projects, which reach out a friendly hand to the wider community, and target issues which harm public well-being; like, homelessness, poverty, isolation. 

The community is built on the motto ‘Local Action for Global Change’ due to the core belief that local people coming together and targeting a societal issue using creative and positive ideas collected from around the world, are far more effective in most situations than outsiders coming and making change for them. They can adapt ideas to fit the local culture, while teaching people how to come together and ‘do it ourselves’ empowers us all to understand that it is the local community is ours, and together we have the power to shape it into the place we dream of living in.

Actions are always based on positivity. There are times in the world when anger and forceful action is necessary. They are fortunately rare, while action based around a clear goal, plan and built upon positivity often becomes irrepressible. Like 'Gay Pride Parades’. Action that is adaptive, agreeable, and incites more people to follow it can become impossible to argue against like swimming against a river, with nothing to grab onto. Eventually there is no other option than to give up and go with the flow.

The Public Happiness Movement was created because Facebook, and other social media platforms, made it increasingly difficult for groups engaged in trying to incite positive action for positive societal change. Maintain their efforts became ever more difficult and their reach minimised, as social media switched to a ‘pay to play’ model. This is the perfect time, and opportunity, to unite everyone working for a positive cultural shift to a society based on well-being and peace - offering. For a global movement to occur a new platform is needed, where enhanced tools and a powerful ecosystem is used to combine and magnify their message for a brighter future. 

The Focallocal Community built this ‘Public Happiness Movement’ platform and is offering it to all other groups with a shared/similar mission.

**Economic Background**
Today’s society is based on GDP, with almost every political decision weighed against this to see if it should go ahead. The founder of GDP, Simon Kuznets campaigned against its use as a primary tool, arguing that it was never intended to be the base our societies were built upon. He designed GDP in 1937 solely for the post war recovery and believed it was entirely unsuitable as the main measure of societal success/well-being because it undervalued and ignored large areas that are critical to a healthy, functioning society. 

*‘the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined by the GDP’* - Simon Kuznets

The Charity model exists largely to paper over these cracks, but has rarely been able to fully resolve a serious societal issue. That is because the fuel causing these issues is that our societies use GDP as their primary measure of success, and solving these issues rarely produces a direct GDP increase. Consider the issue of homelessness, where a vast amounts of money have been donated to charities doing excellent work supporting those who are homeless... yet people are still living on the streets in every major city in the World. GDP has a painfully obvious blind spot here which the charity model is unable to resolve. Our nations are getting ever more wealthy and yet people still regularly freeze to death on the streets.

Crypto-economics is the golden opportunity to redress these economic imbalances and blind-spots. Preventing the hurt and misery they’ve caused to so many humans, all across the world from continuing.  

The Public Happiness Token aims to be a pillar in beginning that essential re-balance, by incentivizing action. both globally, and locally. To identify to resolve these critical and overlooked areas essential to a healthy society – and by doing so from the people, upwards. Totally bypassing slow-moving, and too often corrupt governmental process.

*‘We need to move beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as our main measure of progress and fashion a sustainable development index that puts people first’* - Ban Ki Moon, at the time UN Secretary General

## 1.4.

**Public Happiness Token: Introduction**
Public Happiness Token is an ERC20 Token created from Ethereum blockchain. The Token itself will have few modifications, with its value to society, and for trading, coming from its unique use in engaging community members in activities and projects to create a happier, safer and friendlier society for their local community.

While we talk about 'Tokenising Happiness' and call our community 'The Public Happiness Movement', a more accurate definition of our mission would be 'to increase peace and well-being in the world, using localised positive action'. We use the term 'happy' because regardless of language it's easily recognisable, even though it's not as precise as it could be. 

All Public Action is organised via our platform publichappinessmovement.com and app. Our web-based platform has been built entirely by volunteers who support the vision and is already operational in Beta, early-launch stage. 

Integration of a token into the platform which rewards community members for actions which support our mission, creates a fuel supporting our rapidly growing community, using the platform and ecosystem to create projects and activities to bring positive change into the world, more effective than anything we can imagine yet, because it will be the combined imagination of millions of users.

The Public Happiness Token can be earned ('mined') by using our platform to take action on local societal issues to create greater well-being nearby. Action which occurs in the real world is tracked through hash-tagging photos and videos on social media, and via feedback from other community members. 

The Token is also mined by taking actions essential to the smooth functioning, and growth of the platform, crypto-economic network, and community (for example, bounty hunting to catch users trying to cheat the system, or by completing micro-volunteering tasks to build projects).

Founder Andy has always built the Public Happiness Movement based upon people rather than money, because of the negative effect its presence and pressures often have on people, and societies. Choosing to live an extremely frugal lifestyle in order to focus full-time on Public Happiness; living in a van and working side jobs where needed to support the vision rather than applying for funding or running crowd-funders. The Focallocal Community was built and maintained for 7 years almost entirely on the concept of kindness, avoiding money wherever possible. 

Blockchain gives everyone the ability to create new economic systems and models, creating a new and intriguing possibility to super-charge our positive impact by creating a currency which is intrinsically linked to creating individual, and societal well-being; bringing more peace and happiness to the world each and every time it is used. Public Happiness Token aims to be that currency.

## 2.2.

**Primary Goal**
We live under a system which rewards actions which advance our society’s economic output, but largely ignores our societal well-being outside of that narrow spectrum. It increasingly pressurises humanity to focus on what advances GDP, leaving important work in the community for charities, and councils to try and patch over. 

We strongly believe that societal, and individual well-being should be treated as an equal, or even higher priority in our global society than economic. Public Happiness Token’s main goal is to provide people with an incentive to unite and work together in making their local community a happier, safer and friendlier place by tackling social issues that reduce well-being like homelessness, loneliness, crime rates, isolation, etc.

**Secondary Goal**
This project also aims to empower ordinary people regardless of their technological ability, to become fluent in cryptocurrency transactions, smart contracts and distributed ledger technology. Through their interactions with our platform and the Public Happiness Token they will gain an entry point of understanding of blockchain, the potential uses for blockchain technology, and its ability to transform society and the world they live in by building a world where creating social good is as important as manufacturing or banking. Their understanding of the fiat currencies they use daily will also be forever changed.

**Community and Human Connection**	

Those seeking power at the expense of others liberty throughout history have always prioritized stoking divisions, intolerance, and nativism to prevent any organised social movements from building up and moving society forward in any way. Community and human connection is the key to progress on all societal issues facing humanity, and the key to resisting oppressive forces seeking to divide us for their own selfish aims. The foundation of our movement is connection.

## 2.5.

**Relation to Universal Basic Income**
Universal Basic Income is another concept which has the potential to create societies where many people use their increased freedom to focus on and tackle societal issues. 
It's a sad situation when people want to do things to make their local community a better place to live, but the current system creates a situation where most feel too busy or too stressed about work and the rapid pace of life to consistently engage in this important action. A situation Universal Basic Income has the potential to change, yet UBI faces many hurdles to become accepted policy in all nations. It is likely to be a long and bumpy road and its implementation is likely to differ widely. Public Happiness Token can be considered as a step on a similar path, and one which would compliment UBI by incentivizing those living in societies who adopt it to utilize some of that increased freedom to focus on improving life where they live, and the human condition.

**Current State of Public Understanding**
The general public’s current understanding of cryptocurrency is overwhelmingly narrow. Most have heard of Bitcoin and understand it’s something like an alternative currency to Fiat. The narrative pushed by the news is rarely about the multitude of exciting technologies being built upon blockchain and smart contracts, or the ethos of decentralisation which crypto-economics was founded upon, which will shape the future of our society.  They might have heard something about a hack, Ethereum, or perhaps something about some cyber-kitties ..most people simply don’t really understand what all the fuss is about as it’s not a recognisable part of their world yet.

## 3.2.

**Reaching a New Audience**
Public Happiness Token reaches an entirely new audience, as well as taking our token onto the streets to interact with the wider public and positively impact their daily lives. We aim to use this as an opportunity to introduce more people, across all the different areas of society to an understanding of the basics of blockchain technology, that it has real world uses, and how it can impact the world they live in.

We intend to offer:

* An open platform which guides community members on a journey from absolute beginners, to workable understanding of blockchain technology and how to interact with it.

* The opportunity to earn (mine), own, trade and understand our token and crypto-economic network.

* Introducing people to the idea that they can now choose alternatives to Fiat currencies (£,$,E) to support by adopting and using – demonstrated through the ability to use a currency which is intrinsically linked to creating societal good, Public Happiness Token.

* Guiding community members to create a wallet, transfer tokens to an exchange, and trade for fiat or other cryptocurrencies. Teaching community members good practices for cold storage

* Teaching community members to spot scam tokens and those which run against the principles of decentralisation


Our team firmly believes the future of our society will be built on the blockchain. Right now public perception and understanding is extremely limited outside of a narrow tech-minded segment. Public Happiness Token aims to take a highly visibility and engaging token out onto the streets all across the world, reaching the lives of the general public with blockchain technology in a way that has never been done before.

Users of our platform’s 1st step to owning a cryptocurrency will via the world they already understand - public events, project building and social media - rather than purchasing on an exchange, which is difficult for those with less interest in tech or financial markets. We will then guide them to a more complete understanding.

## 4.1.

**Token Overview**
7.6 Billion Public Happiness Tokens will be created as a new ERC20 token from the Ethereum Blockchain, this amount is fixed and will never change. In theory every human alive could hold one each. It's a nice thought anyway, and signals our intention of being decentralised and taking every effort to avoid whales owning large percentages of our token

People new to blockchain can find the numbers of decimal places a challenge to grasp initially. Starting with a high number of tokens and low decimal limit of 4, we will make that 1st step a little easier for newcomers, whilst still taking a small step from the standard two decimal integer of Fiat currencies.


Public Happiness Token is given value through its initial IEO, later trading of the token on stock exchanges, and the ability to use it in place of Fiat currencies in the real world (either through creating partnerships with businesses, or guiding community members onto token switching payments solutions)

‘Mining’ Public Happiness Token is a process of earning it through agreed behaviours which increase happiness and well-being in the users local community, coordinating collaborative global efforts at local level change, or performing tasks essential to running and building our ecosystem.

This mining process means that the currency is naturally deflationary as set amounts are automatically released from our treasury. Initially we anticipate this deflation to be offset by a rapidly increasing value due to a low starting market cap, and later the number of tokens owned will probably make this deflationary force negligible.

Mining is built on real world action, creating a soft upper limit on how much can realistically be earned. This is designed in a way that minimises the risk of token centralisation. 

Our token is immutable, and will create a permanent record of the effort everyone has put into improving life in their local community.

## 4.2.

**Criteria**

The Public Happiness Movement targets its positive action on the following categories: 

- Public Playfulness
- Environment and Sustainability
- Art, Music, Dance and Poetry
- Health and Well-being
- Human and Community Connection
(which all have subcategories)

If a great idea comes up which advances our mission and doesn't fit into one of these categories then there is room to expand. 


The community is asked to weigh global projects against:

- Deliverability (estimated time to complete)
- Estimated Impact on the targeted issue

Community members can vote on these to give it an 'estimated project' score using Scrum's value estimation model

1, 2 ,3 ,5 ,8 ,13 ,21

A vote from a user is still weighed as their one single vote multiplied by their community contribution score. So giving a higher score doesn't change the weight of their vote. 
 
The community is also asked to ensure the project keeps with the founding vision by checking it meets with all of our [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844)

## 5.1.

**IEO Strategy**
To raise funds to build/improve our network a portion of tokens will be sold off in an initial coin offering.

Many tokens limit their early sales to a small group of large investors, creating centralised tokens which are easily, and often manipulated by their wealthy ‘whale’ investors to game the system and increase their wealth, this also leads to a centralised collection of the wealth, something fundamentally against the ethos blockchain technology was founded upon. 

ICO’s have also become a hotbed for scams, junk tokens, and projects that have no need to be on blockchain at all. To avoid being in that category and to create a token which is widely and evenly distributed amongst both those engaged in crypto, and new people who haven’t yet engaged in the blockchain revolution, we will hold an IEO spread across three stages, limiting initial investments allowed per person and using platforms easily accessible to a wide audience, regardless of previous exposure to cryptocurrencies.

There will be no pre-sale to big time investors. Guaranteed opportunities for everyone to get involved, and every possible effort made to prevent whales from eating up large amounts of our token and undermining the decentralised mission of this project.

    {
        title: "IEO Stages",
        code: "ICOSta",
        fullText: ` 

## 5.2.

**IEO Stages**
Stage 1: Crowd Funding
This stage will be held on a crowd funding website to reach those who don’t understand how to join in a traditional ICO. Investors will be rewarded set amounts for donating at increasing intervals. The top threshold of reward for donations will be set at 100 ETH per user. Investors may choose to invest more to support the project, but will not receive more tokens than stated.

Stage 2: IEO 
Having demonstrated to the crypto savvy world our ability to raise funds and reach those outside the normal circles, a second IEO will be held using the traditional industry tools. Investors will have 30 days to register an Ethereum address. Once the IEO opens a pre-set number of tokens will be released. registered investors will be capped initially at 100 ETH that can be invested in the first 24 hours. This way, everyone that registers has 24 hours to get in, and the token should from the beginning, be decentralised among a wide crowd rather than being owned by a few big whales. 

Stage 3: Crowd Funding and IEO 
A third IEO will be held a few months later on both platforms above. The initial seed funding will have increased the skills, resources and energy available, and these will have led to some 1st major progressive steps in the project build, greatly increasing the capacity of this IEO.  

Email addresses will not be collected at any stage to prevent issues as seen in the Bee Token phishing scams during their ill-fated ICO

Burning unpurchased tokens:
If all of the tokens have not been purchased we will burn the ones that have not been sold. This will increase the value of the token in line with the demand of the IEO and the supply of our token. For example:

50% - 4.85 Billion Tokens are offered for purchase by the public with the number available for purchase increasing at each stage, to reward our earliest backers.

When IEO ends if 3 billion tokens have been purchased, and the price of the token is valued at £0.20.
Burning the tokens that were unsold, will lead to a value increase of 24% for those who purchased during the IEO (price is an example).

        code: "OnFufo",
        fullText: ` 

## 5.3. 

**Ongoing Funding for Specific Projects and Experts**
Initially specialists will be recruited to lead development in each area. To do this we will reward them in our tokens, so everyone on the ecosystem is rewarded in the same way, and at the same level (based on their reputation). Many of the most talented specialists will be understandably unwilling to be rewarded in a new token. This will be navigated by creating a contract with them that we will buy back their tokens at a set rate on a specific date - if they choose to.
 Although this could seem to be a pointless complication, it; 
- Provides a seamless transition from paid specialists leading teams, to our members taking over. 
- Makes it easier for those specialists to remain involved after their initial contracted period, if they wish.
- Before the token is launched and becomes valuable, it smoothes potential friction between those being paid for their contributions, and those receiving our tokens.
- Probably makes it more likely that some will choose to keep a percentage in our tokens and thus stay more engaged in the growth of the community.
 As the community matures the allocation of funds will be opened up fully to decentralised voting on allocation. Users subscribed to the funding allocation channel will engage in discussion and voting around how to distribute funds released from our vault between issues like: 

* specific projects

* platform improvements

* further contracts with experts to resolve an issue facing the community

* buying back tokens to increase their value


Reimbursements:

Team members/tasks reimbursement levels will be determined by a project finance specialist at the 1st stage of the decentralisation process - this means that the early community and specialists building it aren’t able to vote to give themselves a larger share of the token, as happened recently with the EOS community. This kind of selfish grabbing of resources by the initial team members undermines the decentralised nature, and ability to build a reputation of trust, for any blockchain community.

**IEO Marketing**

Crowd-funding:
The IEO will also be launched via a popular crowd funding website, where those donating more than certain set amounts will receive a listed amount of Public Happiness Tokens as a reward. This makes our IEO more accessible than others before, to those with little understanding of Blockchain/Cryptocurrency, by using a format they are more likely to be familiar with.

Those who purchase Tokens via crowd funding will receive instructions on how to create a crypto wallet account and guide to storing their Public Happiness Movement ERC20 tokens – Likely the 1st steps into understanding how to interact with blockchain for many.



Gifting Public Happiness Token:
Part of the IEO marketing (and ongoing marketing afterwards) will have a focus on ‘gifting’ the token to friends and relatives. Accomplished by entering their email and a message for them when purchasing. This gifting may also be made possible over popular social media platforms. 

Most people have now heard something about Cryptocurrencies, and are curious. By offering those donating the option to gift a token which benefits issues the receiver sees in their local community, we have introduced a simple way to tap into that curiosity.

Public Happiness Partners:
Existing groups who are taking action for more peace and happiness in this world, in a manner currently neglected by today's economic system; and whose actions align with our [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844), will be invited to use our ecosystem to supercharge their network effect. Drawing more members in to join their activities. Expanding the reach of their message and media through our enhanced tools. Offering more effective methods to coordinate their followers and community into desired actions on our platform. 

They will now be rewarded financially for their continued efforts to improve human and societal well-being when it is in part, coordinated via our platform. This reward will also be selectively backdated, based upon numbers engaged in their activities and media over the past ten years. Rewarding those whose labours have made a consistent positive impact to society, and others lives, without any economic recognition for their great works. This backdated reward is not dependent upon joining our platform, but should increase on-boarding by showing casing the benefits of tokenizing to create a new ‘Happiness Economy’.

The Public Happiness Movement platform currently exists as a website located at https://publichappinessmovement.com. If you’ve visited it you’ve probably noticed it is currently a fragmented site/platform. This is intentional. The platform has been built as a ‘minimal functional platform’ capable of supporting a community who will transform it into an effective decentralised Public Happiness platform; using the tools available to redesign and reshape the platform as it evolves to better fit their collective needs.

The platform is build as an Open Source project which brings people and communities together, both locally and globally, to target an issue they care about. Users of each platform are then rewarded with tokens for their efforts towards the cause that platform is focused on, and for carrying out work which is essential for the overall health of their community/platform/eco-system. 

This means that we can create spin-off platforms which unite humanity around positive action on key issues troubling todays society. It prevents the Meta platform from becoming too cluttered, so it can focus on its mission 'to create more peace and well-being in our world'. It also allows other communities to grow up who will add energy to building and improving the platform. 


**Meta (Publichappinessmovement.com=**


Often referred to as simply 'PHM' our meta platform is also available as an iOS and [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tohu.phmapp&hl=en&gl=US). Its long term goal is to grow large enough to switch to the DAPPs network where the architecture will be hosted by the community members in a peer to peer model, to further the decentralisation of our community and ecosystem.


Teams, Projects, People and Communities:
In the Action Center (Global) are Teams and Projects. Teams are our meta, they refer to our communities internal operations and growth. Projects are ideas our community has agreed to deliver to the world.
In the maps (Gather) are People and Communities. Existing communities with a similar vision can join the platform to take advantage of our ecosystems advanced tools to support their mission and community. People can post themselves for others to contact and arrange positive actions together to target local issues.

Local vs Global:
The Action Center focused on Global projects (and our community operations). Localised projects are smaller and run in the other of the two main sections of our platform, the Gathering section.

The same tools are available to community members creating a localised project, as for those working in the Action Center. Gatherings and the Action Center are mirrors of each other, the difference being that the Gatherings side is set up to highlight the community and social aspects within a members local community, while the Action Center places greater emphasis on the project management side as community members will be joining in from all around the world. The Governance of the global side, and the platform itself is Decentralised. Communities on the local side will bring their own governance structures, as many will be pre-existing and it would be a high bar to force them all to adopt our decentralised governance model.

**The Public Happiness Movement Map**
An area of the platform showing community members the Public Happiness Movement in their local community. Bringing our members, and existing communities and groups, together to connect and take our vision and token to the streets. Community members can create and join in Public Happiness Gatherings from a list of pre-approved activities actively curated by the community; and contact other members nearby to invite them to join them creating happiness in their local community. Community members can list themselves on the map (in an approximate location for privacy), and select all the public happiness activities they would like to be contacted for, creating a searchable map of people nearby who want to meet and take actions which bring more well-being into the world they live in.

The Map also allows community members to explore approved suggestions for Public Happiness Gatherings, along with; 

* Details about the societal issue targeted

* Videos

* How to guides

* Photos of others around the world enjoying that activity

* Peer reviewed studies which support the impact that activity has on society

* Automated pre-generated descriptions of the activity/gathering being run. These partner the user created activity description and ensure that each explains how the societal issue is being targeted accurately

* Quick share buttons for creating events on other social media platforms to help build awareness, and draw more users into our ecosystem

* Leave ‘positive experience’ or ‘negative experience’ feedback on other community members to offer protection from unwanted uses of the platform

Public Happiness Tokens will be distributed amongst those attending, sharing, and organising Public Happiness Gatherings by the Token Distribution Matrix.

To receive tokens community members are required to post their photos and videos to social media with the following hashtags:

#publichappiness #publichappinessmovement #publichappinesstoken #[name of gathering] #[location] #[date of activity or project]. 

This can be considered ‘proof of work’. Their posts will be located autonomously and pulled into an easy to view list to be checked for suspicious behaviour by others in the ecosystem. Token awards are delayed by 2 weeks to allow time for checking. Abuse and fraud is monitored by bounty hunters within the community, and a list of all past hashtags found will be recorded with links to the content, to allow these 'bounty hunters' to review suspicious accounts/activity easily.

**Global/The Action Center**

Overview:
An open micro-volunteering hub, and project management suite where complex projects are broken down into small tasks, or ‘Missions’ anyone can complete. In today's GDP based world innovative ideas to benefit human society are heavily dependent on whether the person having them has the capacity and determination to either find funding and build them. This is an extremely inefficient system where the majority of great ideas to impact the world are lost. 

Our Action Center creates a new path for ideas which benefit humanity to be built. Anyone can suggest an idea using our one page only form. Other community members vote on the ones they believe will have the largest social impact. The winners will be built by our community using our Micro-Volunteering model. These projects have no owner, no set team building them, and require no funding other than our token rewarding those who work on delivering them.

That might be a fairly brief idea, or a full plan they’ve been working on for a while outside of our community and have struggled to get off the ground. The submission to our community should be a single A4 page with the outline of the project as we want to avoid creating a system which rewards those who put in months of preparation and have access to skills and resources which the average person doesn’t - which would just recreate the existing system of applying for funding to get a project off the ground.

Our system is for quickly identifying a great idea which can advance human and societal well-being, and then together building it.


How Selecting a New Project Works:

1) It begins with a great idea from a community member for a project to target a societal benefit in one of our categories:

- Public Playfulness
- Environment and Sustainability
- Art, Music, Dance and Poetry
- Health and Well-being
- Human and Community Connection

2) The idea goes into a period of discussion and voting, where the community positively debates the idea suggesting improvements, or ways to avoid potential pitfalls.

3) The vote continues until a spot opens up in the 'build list'. This happens either because an existing project has been launched, or because the Build section has more activity and can support an extra project being built. 

The community is asked to weigh global projects against:

- Deliverability (estimated time to complete)
- Estimated Impact on the targeted issue

Community members can vote on these to give it an 'estimated value' score using Scrum's value estimation model

1, 2 ,3 ,5 ,8 ,13 ,21

The community will also ensure the project keeps with the founding vision by checking it meets with all of our [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844)

4) The highest voted project idea moves into the Build list to be built by our community, who receive our tokens in reward for their efforts.


Alternate Routes onto the Build List:

1) Companies or altruistic donors can create a new spot to target specific issues they want to see our Public Happiness Community tackle. For example, a company might want an educational community garden built as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility, or marketing budget. Or a philanthropist might put up the money needed to create a new spot in the build list, and specify that it is for Sustainability projects. 

2) Community members can 'stake' their tokens behind an idea to show support. Their stake goes into the funding pool when/if it reaches the build list, where the increased tokens available will attract more community members and increase the speed of the project build. If enough community members stake their tokens behind a project to reach the threshold for creating a new spot on the build list, then that project will take the new spot. 


How Projects Are Built:

1) Once selected by the community vote a core team of 9 community members forms to plan the build. Members can be invited by the ideas originator, any spaces left will be filled by the highest ranking members who joined the voting/discussion and wish to be in the 1st project leaders team, who will be automatically invited. 

2) This 1st group of project leaders creates a 'definition of done' and breaks the entire project build up into its core components. Using Scrum's fibonacci voting system the core team will vote on the importance of each of these core components.

3) Each project is awarded a pot of tokens at the beginning from our vault. These tokens are divided into each core component section based on its importance to delivering the project as defined by the 1st project leaders team

4) Any user can suggest a task which needs to be completed to reach the definition of done. These tasks go into our Backlog List. Each month the current team leaders move the tasks which will advance the project most into the Sprint list. Community members are advised to complete tasks from this list, although they might choose to take one from the backlog list, for example, if they have previous experience so can complete it to a high level. The tasks can be discussed by any other community member

5) All tasks are broken into specific bite-sized chunks which anyone in the wider community can tackle. Tasks should take no longer than an hour; for example, 'create an intro video' would be a bad task as its likely to take longer and involve many smaller specific tasks. 'Review the video script and post feedback to Briony', would be a specific task that should take under an hour for a short video. It won't be possible for this to be precise, but other team members can discuss issues and suggest improvements. Our system of breaking tasks into smaller parts removes one of the biggest problems faced by volunteer communities – well meaning people offering to complete large tasks and not following through, often leading projects to fail as others wait and wait, momentum is lost, and as frustration grows it leads to other volunteers giving up and dropping out also. 

6) The team will have use of Burn Up and Velocity charts which the team leaders can use to judge how many tasks should go into the Sprint list this period. They can also move cards over on the fly, so there will never be nothing waiting for a community member wanting to take positive action.

7) Community Members move a task into the 'Doing' list to claim it (assign themselves a task). If it's not complete within a week the task can be returned to the ‘to do list’ for others to claim and complete preventing projects being held up by well meaning, but unreliable people, as is common in traditional volunteering and Microvolunteering systems.

8) Tokens are distributed for completed tasks, with a two week delay so other community members, and moderators can monitor for any abuse of the system.

9) The initial team should aim to plan as complete of a picture of all tasks that will be needed during the project and they will set how many tokens are available for each task. They should keep 30% of the tokens unassigned ready for important new tasks which were overlooked at the beginning, and any unspent at the end are released as a celebrations reward, divided among everyone who contributed to delivering the project to the world.

10) Each month the Core Team of 9 members changes, based on who was most active on the project in the previous month (and who wants to be in the core team). Creating a dynamic, decentralised system for managing and delivering projects, based on community members reputation and activity levels.


Teams and Projects:
In the Action center are Teams and Projects. Teams are our meta, they refer to our communities internal operations and growth. Projects are ideas our community has agreed to deliver to the world. 

Local vs Global:
The Action Center focused on Global projects (and our community operations). Localised projects are smaller and run in the other of the two main sections of our platform, the Gatherings section. 

The same tools are available to community members creating a localised project, as for those working in the Action Center. The Gatherings side and the Action Center are mirrors of each other, the difference being that Gathering is set up to highlight the community and social aspects within a members local community, while the Action Center places greater emphasis on the project management side as community members will be joining in from all around the world. The Governance of the global side, and the platform itself is Decentralised. Communities on the local side will bring their own governance structures, as many will be pre-existing and it would be a high bar to force them all to adopt our decentralised governance model.

**Community News (or Happy News)**
A user generated ‘Community News’ online magazine. Open for all platform users to create their own articles or share video links. This incentives community members to create, like and share content (articles, photos and videos), increasing reach and inspiring more people to join in the Movement. This user created media from around the world increases the sense of community on our platform, and the feeling of being part of something bigger, a global Movement for positive change.

All articles submitted will be checked by experienced community members who have earned a level of reputation to become moderators. Moderators will operate as copywriters with the ability to edit and improve the quality of content, guided by rules to balance quality with excess interference in content.

Moderators will mine tokens by approving content. Community members will mine tokens either by sharing content, or creating it and receiving likes.

**The Active Happiness Shop**
An integrated Shopify store selling ‘Active Happiness Clothing’ which make a small positive change happen in the world around the wearer simply by putting the item on in the mornings. The clothing is an extension of our Public Happiness activities, with most items functioning as a passive way for each public happiness activity to occur outside of organised activities and gatherings. For example, a shirt informing others that the wearer is carrying bubbles, and inviting people around them to blow some.

Materials and Public Happiness Action Packs are also available. Profits will cover basic costs operational costs, with any excess made available for community members to vote on how best to use it in aid of advancing our projects and community.

Currently hosted on shopify, this will be moved in-house shortly.

## 6.5.

**Who defines what is accepted as ‘Public Happiness?’**
The platform is pre-populated with projects, missions and pre-approved Public Happiness Activities. community members are invited to suggest their own ideas, or bring pre existing projects/activities. These will be discussed by other members in the forums to explore potential issues, and ways to strengthen the impact. Then reviewed by the community to make sure it aligns with our [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844), before being voted on, using our reputation weighted community governance model, and then approved or not. This ensures the original vision is maintained, while providing space for members creativity and ability to shape their platform. Note: this doesn't prevent communities joining our platform from having their own governance structure internally.

Effective ideas for positive action will be incorporated into the platform and recommended to other community members as tools they can use for creating positive  social and cultural change where they live.

## 6.6.
	
**Community Values**
	

1. Welcoming

Our community is based upon an open environment of connection and positivity. All causes and opinions are valid and respected as people agree to put aside their affiliations for a while, allowing us to be open to everyone in our community, as a human, apart from our passionately held points of view which so often divide us

By focusing on what connects us instead of what divides us, we create a safe space where we teach the important skill of learning how to come together, as humans, around a project or activity which benefits the local communities we live in


2. An Open Human Space

Leave all political leanings, religions and spiritual beliefs at the door. Our positive action based community is open to everyone, simply as human-beings together. Everyone at a gathering may agree that the Flying-Spaghetti Monster is the way forwards, while those passing-by may be strictly Dudeists and not feel welcomed to join. It is an intensely liberating experience to just see, and be seen as a human exploring the many paths in life, just as everyone else is

Projects focusing on issues may appear to side with one political leaning or another, but our sole focus is on the root issue causing harm in society, and not on political bickering


3. Evidence Based

Every activity and action is based on peer reviewed scientific studies. Action must be anchored to humanity’s best current understanding of reality to ensure that energies are focused on making legitimate change in the world as effectively as possible. This differentiates the Public Happiness Movement from a hippie revival, or new age spiritualist/religious community

As a side benefit this teaches people to critically examine today’s flood of social media pushed anti-intellectualism, helping to act efficiently in life, and in supporting their local community

4. People and Innovative Technology Grounded

The Public Happiness Movement is grounded in technological innovation, and exploring their use to coordinate locally, while sharing the most effective ideas for creating positive societal change globally. Innovative technology should be harnessed to empower people and communities, giving everyone the tools to transform the world around them into a friendlier, safer, and happier place to live our lives in

5. Comfortable

Activities should be comfortable for anyone to attend. This means striking a balance between what is considered local cultural norms for children, while pushing society towards greater acceptance of each other. As a rule of thumb our mantra is ‘your rights end where someone else’s begin’. So a Tantra, nudism, or bdsm group doing a free hug event advertising their group name or ideologies, would be inappropriate through association. Their members would all be welcome without discussing the group/lifestyle where young people can hear it.

6. Encouraging

We are all on a journey of exploration and we support and encourage all of our fellow adventurers. Some may not get it right away, so please guide their ideas and suggestions to fit with these Community Values, using plenty of positive encouragement


7. Smiling

You’ve found a home for your lovely smile, positivity and enthusiasm. Please bring it along to our activities and projects, especially those targeting serious issues. All smiles are beautiful! Please share yours with the world, and with each other


8. Sharing

Our community is about sharing – sharing ideas, experiences, success stories, talents and smiles!

As a world-wide network – our whole is so vastly greater than the sum of our parts. When we come together with a shared vision, and an organised plan of the steps needed to achieve it, we as a collective of individuals, are powerful beyond imagination!

 

9. Empowering

Our community is focused on providing you with the tools and support needed to create change on social issues you care about through uniting with other positive and proactive people nearby and using the most effective ideas collected worldwide from our community.

Consider the issue of involuntary homelessness, where endless money has been given to charities around the world, and yet most countries are no closer to ending homelessness than they were in the 60’s. If people in a town simply came together around effective ideas and a determination to resolve the issue ourselves, it would be gone forever in no time

10. Rippling

How can helping a few homeless folk feel less isolated in a small town in Hungary, or creating greater connection between folk in a community in Dorset, really change the wider world in any way?

The activities and projects you create locally through our platform may seem small when we talk about making an impact on a global scale. Your energy and positivity is an essential part of growing an interconnected community of people, all exploring positive new ways to affect issues troubling their local community.

By sharing our small successes, each successful activity can be recreated thousands and thousands of times by other community members across the globe, and together those ripples combine into an unstoppable wave of positive action that can have a real impact for positive societal change, globally!

11. Locally Lead

Our main mission is to empower individuals and communities to create positive change themselves. While many of our projects and activities occur on a global scale, they are always implemented by local people who understand cultural differences where they live, and will be there to keep the ball rolling afterwards.

One caveat is that some members use our platform to pimp their travelling experience, as the most positive and amazing people are also the local people wanting to be contacted to meet (‘gather’) and take positive action to the streets where they live. Local people using our platform are still central even when initiated by a member who is travelling, so using the platform while travelling fits with this value.

12. Snowballing

All of your positive actions on our platform help spread awareness of the Public Happiness Movement. Reaching more people who want to live in a happier world with our message that it is possible, and they have the power to build it, today!

As more people are drawn into our mission, the effects of your actions that reached them are magnified far beyond what you can see. Each new member who joins in adds more positive energy as our Movement grows into an unquenchable force of change for a friendlier, happier world – at peace with each other, for all of humanity to enjoy!!

## 6.7.

**Evidence Based and Peer Reviewed**
When community members submit a new idea for a project or activity its recommended that they find peer reviewed studies to offer support for the benefits their idea will have on society. This promotes the core concept that all efforts to effect a positive cultural and societal change, should be rooted in the best current understanding of available evidence. Community members will be guided to place where they are likely to find sources, as we want to build an informed and competent community. Those who are discussing and reviewing it for approval may add more sources. Part of our ecosystem will be ‘Research Bounty-Hunting’, where community members are rewarded for finding new peer reviewed studies to add to already approved activities, or which lead to the removal of an outdated study.

**Who can Participate on the Platform**
The platform is open to anyone wanting to create well-being and happiness where they live, or support the Movement. 

Some community members may choose to use it while travelling, as a great way to meet positive local people. Community members travelling are naturally guided towards ‘gathering’ with local people who understand the local customs and any adaptations necessary.

Pre-existing communities may wish to join the ecosystem to take advantage of the network effect, or be part of a wider community.

## 6.9.

**Pre-existing Communities with Similar Values**
Groups and communities already doing excellent work in creating Public Happiness and well-being projects/activities where they live, are all welcomed to use our platform and ecosystem to supercharge their positive impact on society.

They can create community pages, with tools for community building and engagement; and for guiding their members into actions which benefit their community and mission. For example, their own forum, the ability to contact their members (according to the users notification preferences) more effectively than existing community building platforms, or giving community members tokens for sharing activities/created media on other social media platforms.


Their existing activities and projects will need to be submitted in the usual way, to be approved by other network users, and checked that they align with our communities ‘Core Values’ statement. 

Platform users can join groups to be informed about their activities and projects, and to be an active part of  contributing to their mission.

        code: "DeGoan",

## 6.11.

**Decentralised Governance and Voting**

Earning Votes:
Votes can only be earned on our platform, not bought. Completing tasks related to creating more peace and well-being in the ways defined in the [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844) statement, or carrying out tasks essential for the smooth operation and growth of the ecosystem is considered 'mining', as it is the energy put in to validate our collective mission (also as a tool to begin teaching community members Cryptocurrency basics). This 'mining' earns tokens, and also voting rights. These are separate, so that community members cannot buy influence. 

The points earned which give community members their voting ranks are on a centralised autonomous system so they cannot be traded (the two separate systems are also used to teach the difference between a centralised token and decentralised one). The centralised ledger of every token mined (earned) is used to assign ranks for vote weighting. The central database is open to public scrutiny to create trust that it's not being manipulated by anyone. 


How Voting Works on the Ecosystem:
Each area and section of the platform has a discussion forum linked where community members can discuss improvements to the operations and design of their community and platform, creating a mass decentralised governance system for The Public Happiness Movement.

Community members wanting to raise a vote on a platform or operational change can post in the attached forum calling for a vote, and explaining the need. Others will vote for or against, with 60% needed to pass. 

Community members are welcomed to comment their thoughts in the threads for, and against, to guide voting. The threads will be ordered by likes received so the strongest arguments float to the top.

How Voting Works to Choose New Projects:
All community members can suggest a new project by filling in a structured form on our platform. The form limits users to roughly a single A4 page, to avoid recreating systems where to get an idea funded someone has to commit considerable time and resources. Other community members then can discuss, and vote on this idea. When a space opens up in the build list (either because another project is complete, or because capacity increases within the ecosystem creating a new spot) the project moves into the build list where it is built and delivered by our community.

Staking:
Community members are also welcome to 'stake' their tokens behind a project they really want to see delivered and changing lives in the real world. Staked tokens go into the pool used to create the project should the project be voted into the Build list by the community, increasing the rewards available and therefore the speed its built. It also has some influence in the voting process as other community members can see that project will be created faster if they support it. This mechanism can also be utilised to push through an idea with a small but passionate following. If a group of members pool their resources and staje enough tokens to reach the set threshold required to open a new spot in the build list, then the project will take the new spot without needing to win the popular vote.


Sectional Voting:
An issue faced by many decentralised voting systems is that community members are either inundated with votes, or not consulted on smaller issues. Our wide-ranging ecosystem is designed for small groups to form around specific teams relating to skills (such as Marketing, Graphic Design, SEO, etc), and also around specific projects and activities. These groups need to be given autonomy to make decisions in their areas of interest/expertise, yet these decisions must have oversight of the whole community to prevent pockets operating their on a different agenda to the whole. 

This is solved by creating streamlined voting system, where all votes are created and voted on in their specific area, but also appear in a central voting thread to create constant oversight from the wider community, who can join the vote and call wider attention, if something is occurring which flows upstream against the [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844).

Key Votes:
Higher ranking community members can send out notifications to all members when important votes occur. This flexibility means that a vote can begin in the UX/UI team, and be escalated to a site-wide vote as soon as wider implications become clear and members deem it to be of interest to everyone.


Gatherings vs Action Center/Local vs Global:
The Governance of the Action Center (Global) side, the platform and ecosystem itself is Decentralised. Communities on the local side will bring their own governance structures which they should be able to use on our forums perfectly well. Many will be pre-existing and it would be a high bar to force them all to adopt our decentralised governance model in order to join us. 

Protection from Brigading: 
Community members votes are weighted based on the reputation they’ve built by contributing to our project, so those most closely aligned and invested to the vision laid out in the community values will have more influence on decision making as a counter to anyone seeking to manipulate voting. 

The ecosystem's bounty hunters (a team open to all members to join) receive rewards for finding subversive coordination and general misuse of the platform. They also receive rewards for the number of desired platform actions which they review and approve. All votes in our ecosystem are cross posted into voting threads where anything out of the ordinary can be spotted easily and brought to the attention of the wider community. 

For more information on security, see Chapter 8.


Off-chain Voting:
The reason for separating voting from our token is to prevent whales from buying influence in deciding the direction of the community and ecosystem. Community members influence should be based on their contribution to the vision and community, rather than their wealth. A case illustrated clearly by the issues currently faced by the Aragon community, where a single whale had a [massively out-sized impact on their second community vote](https://www.evanvanness.com/post/184616403861/aragon-vote-shows-the-perils-of-onchain-governance). There is no-way to know how much the whale had contributed to the network. 


Lack of Understanding:
Community members aren’t all expected to be experts on blockchain or community governance. They will naturally gravitate to areas of their interests and expertise, leading to more people with an understanding of a topic being subscribed to that section when a vote is called. This gives them the ‘first mover’ advantage to get informed arguments in to give a greater understanding to those joining in from the main voting category in the forum.

## 6.12. 

**User Behaviour in UX Design**
The platform is designed to create a culture of qualitative engagement, rather than maximising quantitative engagement to increase advertising revenue harvested from community members. The model today's main social media sites have switched to wants users to click and move on, rather than engage - this comes at the expense of communities or events organisers seeking to build a community in the online world. For example, on Facebook events the event description is now hidden from users, requiring them to actively seek it out. FB doesn't want users to slow down and read what they are actually attending or joining, and creating a participatory community in this environment is increasingly difficult. Today's social media wants users to click, and move on as quick as possible. 

Teaching community members to participate rather than just consume is going to be a challenge. Countless studies have shown attention spans of the general population have reduced constantly over the past years. This challenge is not one we shy away from, as it is a core component in our mission of increasing well-being and happiness. Creating a platform where users are an active and recognised part of our community and mission is a core concept.

Community members attending a gathering on our platform are not passive. Everyone attending is an organiser and expected to contribute, even if that is as quick as simply saying hello in the forum and sharing with their friends on other platforms. A pro-active, participatory community is essential, and that is included in our design goals to compliment the tokenisation effect, rather than rely on it solely to change users expected online behaviour.

## 6.13. 

**Maintaining productivity in an open forum (Our coloured threads)**
One of the major challenges faced by open communities, where anyone around the world can join a team and begin contributing, is that the teams focus is constantly interrupted when new members join in and drop new ideas which need addressing before the team can continue with the work or discussion they were focused on. This makes it difficult for teams to maintain momentum and reach an efficient flow state for efficient progress on tasks they are working on.

When a group forms into a team to take action on a task they go through distinct phases: 

1 (White). Members begin by discussing the task and presenting as many ideas to tackle it as possible. 
2 (Yellow). The team evaluates and improves the most promising of the suggestions through debate. 
3 (Green). Team chooses through obvious consensus, or voting, which plan suggested will be most effective at solving the task.
4 (Orange).  Team members agree individual tasks and embark on the work needed to complete that plan

The issue in an open-world style platform is that new people can join in at any phase and often have  new ideas, which may or may not be valid, but they require the team to interrupt progress and address them, setting discussion back to an earlier stage which greatly reduces the efficiency of the overall system when it occurs often. 

To prevent this and allow teams on our platform to reach a flow state of efficiency, each discussion In our ‘Global’ forum has a different background colour which corresponds to the stage the discussion is currently in. With this system new team members know, or are quickly told, how they can interact with that team and task in a beneficial way.

Examples: 
Stage 1 (White) - If a community member enters a discussion thread in stage 1 they know that all their ideas are welcome
Stage 2 (Yellow) – Now at stage two they can best support the task by discussing and contributing to the ideas already presented
Stage 3 (Green) - Members should be commenting or voting on one of the two or three most popular plans
Stage 4 (Orange) - Teams in an orange build phase really don’t want new members coming in and saying ‘wait, stop what you’re doing and lets do this instead’, so entering an orange thread members will know that their comments should be made in relation to completing the already agreed upon plan.

Breaking the chain - New ideas are always welcome and anyone can still present their new idea for solving a task at any time if they believe its significantly better than the plan(s) currently being worked on. Members do this by creating a completely new thread for their idea where the team currently working on the task can address the new idea, but without slowing momentum in the original thread. If that new idea gains traction then someone could call a discussion and vote to determine which one members want to continue with. Occasionally a significant number of members may choose not to abide by the vote meaning there will be two competing attempts to solve the task. In this scenario the best one will be decided by which functions best on completion, decided by a community wide vote.

(see section 6.11 for more information on voting).

## 6.14. 

**User Wall and Plugin Module Ecosystem**
Logged in community members will arrive on their profile page and wall each time they visit. A community members profile page contains three types of features:

1. Community Communications - embedded in the main menu are notifications from communications across our site and forum.

2. Actions - community members are prompted to take the main actions which will fuel the Movements growth, and deliver its positive impact on society. Actions like; filling in a profile to add themselves to the map. Creating a group. Searching for community members/activities nearby to meet and create positive actions with.

3. Members Wall - the largest of these spaces, where community members have the ability to choose which components/information they'd like to see. This area will be open to plug-in creators allowing customisation and increased ownership of users over their profile. Encouraging innovation will improve the user experience on our platform.


**Expanding on the Members Wall**

The easiest way to visualise this, for those who remember it, is that this will be similar to the ecosystem Facebook had before they locked users into only the behaviour the company desired. In many ways our entire platform could be described as user led design already due to the decentralised governance model, but most areas will be designed and set by the majority through user voting. The wall is a section to allow more individual flexibility and a tailored experience to the individuals needs and wants.  

The community members wall space will come pre-populated with default modules which the community has chosen as the most effective to help beginners to get a grip on what is going on within the Public Happiness Movement, and how best to engage. Community members have the freedom to change these at any time. 

Developers will be free to create modules that fit any purpose, so long as their use isn't going against any of the Communities Core Values (something easily checked by other community members by posting ideas in the forum before building them). 

Default modules might include:

- Getting started challenges, to guide community members through a general understanding of what interesting things they can do within our ecosystem, plus with token and badge rewards for completing them
- A calendar of upcoming gatherings they've subscribed to
- A calendar of nearby gatherings, and international action days
- Thumbnails of recently active community members nearby, to promote the feeling of a community
- Charts showing levels of activity within the ecosystem; locally, in each section, and in their geographic areas (country and city)
- Their wallet showing the amount of tokens they've earned for their actions to bring more peace and well-being into the world, and to complete tasks important to the healthy running of our ecosystem. This would include live tracking of the tokens price compared to other currencies/tokens
- A voting tracker to show key votes/votes in areas they've subscribed to/all current votes
- Courses for learning the basics of blockchain and cryptocurrency
- Modules with courses to improve your happiness

Optional modules might include:

- Charts showing activity with predicted completion (burn up/burn down) dates for projects they've subscribed to
- Recent news stories from our forum from categories they've subscribed to
- Friends recent activity on the platform
- News from communities on our platform that they've joined
- Recent videos or photo streams from action all across the world (pulled from social media via hashtags)
- Challenges created by community members
- Trending stats about our Movement and projects on social media
- Habit tracking to help community members form healthy habits
- Portals to groups of community members learning new skills by following online courses together, like marketing or web development

The possibilities are endless and we can't wait to see what is created here!

Forum specific plug-ins can also be built easily through the existing Discourse architecture.

## 7.1.

**Benevolent Dictatorship vs Complete Community Governance**
Primarily, we expect platform users/community members who rise to higher rankings through their actions to increase human and societal well-being, to be invested in the overall vision by the time they reach the upper levels. Their greater influence on decision making will lead the ecosystems culture, creating a force to protect the platform from abuse and actions which run against our Core Values. 

It would be poor planning not to also consider more 'attack' scenarios, and ways to mitigate the risks, while assessing how our platform, ecosystem, and community could be impacted. Then to use this information in deciding on how we best to weigh the ideological value of complete decentralisation, against the importance of introducing our members to the concepts of community governance in measured stages to ensure the integrity of the vision.

## 7.2.

**Example Scenario: Outside Collusion**
A significantly sized outside group infiltrate our platform, operating as model members, or pretending to and avoiding detection. Once reaching a high enough rank to influence a vote they collude to state that ‘watching tv and drinking beer’ meets with our Core Values and should be approved as a Public Happiness Activity.

Or more concerningly perhaps ‘Rallies supporting a religious hard-line political candidate’ meet the criteria.

        title: "Lines of Defence",
        code: "LiofDe",
        fullText: `

## 7.3.

**Lines of Defence**
1st Line: 
The culture of a community built from members focused on creating ‘social good’ will lead those reaching a higher level to be benevolent with their increased influence.

2nd Line: 
Our ‘Bounty Hunting’ model incentivises community members to monitor unusual behaviour patterns, and to find external groups coordinating action outside of the scrutiny of the wider community. Then to report it bringing it to everyone's attention. 

3rd Line: 
On-chain governance usually means influence can be bought. Instead a weighted governance model is created based on a users contributions to the mission and ecosystem. Thereby those most committed to the vision will become the ones with most influence in guiding it. Most of the platform and ecosystem will become open to redesign by community voting. 

Some aspects should be protected by the founding members to safeguard from potential attacks and degradation of the initial vision, for example; the Core Values can be influenced by a vote calling for an improvement, but not changed directly. The founders would need to give an extremely strong reason for resisting a popular change, or risk undermining the trust of their community.

Voting: 
We use a captcha when voting to protect against machine/bot voting. (definitely not the awful Google click all the tiles with X in them captchas!!)

Last Line: 
Founder Andy retains a 'pause' vote. Intended never to be used, it serves as a last line of defence against subversion of the platform and community away from its core vision.

On initiation of a pause vote 21 members are selected at random (making it functional impossible to corrupt selected members) from the recently active top ranking members. The vote itself will at the same time be posted as a priority issue in the bounty hunting team who will seek anything which could affect the integrity of the vote, or any abnormal patterns. Once the bounty hunting team's report is complete, the 21 random senior members then vote on whether the decision 'paused' to protect the community should be reversed. 11 votes are needed to pass a decision overruling.

The 21 members will have the tools to remove members if needed - for example a lot of new members recently joined and all voted in just one way. 

At an unspecified point in the future, or in the case that Andy is no longer able to use this last line community protection tool, the pause vote will pass to 7 secretly designated members. Their identities unknown even to each other. These members have been determined by a personal judgement on integrity, reliability, and commitment to both the mission, and it's values. Any of these members have the power to begin the pause process on any decision recently voted on by the community. The function for calling a pause requires that the member fully explains why it was used, and this explanation is then posted anonymously to the wider-community for urgent discussion.

## 7.4.

**Conclusion**
To meet our goals and teach community members the core concepts crypto-economics and blockchain, our community needs to move towards a culture of decentralised decision making. Doing so immediately, or fully, would open the platform up to abuse and security risks. For that reason decentralisation will be grandfathered in as the community grows, with the founding team assessing it’s current ability to protect itself from abuse while working towards increasing decentralisation and allowing greater community led governance. 

Some core areas of the project will always remain closed to change via community voting as a final line of defence from abuse, for example, the ‘Core Values’ which the community is based upon. To trigger a necessary change to these protected areas community members could create a vote to bring attention of the core team and put pressure on them to initiate the change, or to engage in further public discussions.

## 8.1.

**Levels of Trust**
Implementing levels of trust, where platform users rise in ranks by performing tasks to maintain and grow the Public Happiness network and ecosystem, means that scammers would be receiving a small sum, unless they first put in much work beneficial to the community to reach to a higher level.  (See section 11.1. for more info on weighted mining).

Community voting will maintain this balance between security vs the incentive for new members joining in. 

A two week holding period before mined tokens are released gives time for bounty hunters and other community members to find and report scams.

Miners creating public activities where much of the work is conducted offline will be required to post hashtags on social media of photos and videos taken at their activity as proof of work, which are tracked by our bot, linked to their account, and published in a list of pending tokens earned, making it simple for other community members and bounty hunters to check if they think something suspicious is going on (the requirement for posting and hashtags is also fantastic marketing for the community and movement).

Our network is designed to make cheating the system more difficult than actually doing the required work.

Experienced members who have contributed to the ecosystem will be invited to become a Community Admin, with extra tools available for supporting other platform users.

Each team and project has a leadership team made up of the nine highest scoring active members within it. Their overall contribution score within our ecosystem is added to their overall contribution to the team or project and then multiplied by how active they were in that team in the previous month. This ensures there is always oversight from experienced users who are passionate about each team, and bad actors would need to show a sustained commitment to the team before being able to harm it.

Tasks completed will need to be approved by admins of each board before rewards are released.

## 8.4. 

**Mining Limits**
A hard limit exists on the amount of tokens one user can earn each week, set to a reasonable limit for how many activities or missions one user can realistically complete to prevent a large scale effort to scam the system. 

The platform will guide community members through creating an off-platform Hot Wallet (to avoid the added risks of holding tokens on our platform), which it will interact with and distribute their earned tokens into. The platform will guide community members to manage their personal digital security in the world of blockchain; teaching them how and why to:

* move the tokens into cold storage

* safely back up their seed

* move their tokens to an exchange to trade

* make purchases with their tokens

* send tokens to friends and family (which will double as a good marketing strategy to grow our community)

* create a secure hot wallet and back up their keys safely

## 8.5.

**Cold Storage and Key Holders**
Our Token:
In our model a large amount of the total Token’s created are held for future release creating obvious security concerns, and also safety concerns for our core team. To reduce these concerns we will be hiring a company who specialise in crypto security to ensure keys are split among the team, and none of our team is able to access the ‘vault’ without a set number of others, and an approved person from outside the project. We will fully automate the regular release of tokens into the platform.

Funds raised through the IEO:

Funds raised through the IEO funds will be stored: 
- in a spread across the top 20 tokens (with small sums in one or two high potential outliers) and held in cold storage (50%)
- EURO’s (50%). 

Both funds will be divided and managed by multiple industry leading cold storage and security company. To spread the risks to our funding across multiple markets and trusted companies.

**Hash-Tagging**
Requiring hash-tagging as proof of work creates a highly effective method of free marketing. Everyone receiving our token through the Public Happiness Activities side of the platform will also be Hash Tagging about the token, flooding all social media platforms with images and videos of happy people around the world engaging in our Movement to massively boost interest and awareness of Public Happiness Token.

The bot will be cross referencing these social media posts against date, activity and location from activities posted on our platform by the user/s who the tokens will be released to.

The proof of work bot will be searching for #PublicHappiness #PublicHappinessMovement #[miners location] #[activity name], and checking the connected social media profile against our database of connected user accounts.

For example: The activity was scheduled for the 8th April 2020, when created on our platform. The images with the hashtags should be posted on the same date with a +7 days leniency for late uploads. The system will then check the hashtags with the details posted on our platform. Late posts can be submitted by community members for review by adding links to their posts and activity into the queue manually.

**Launch Party Hacks**
To launch the Public Happiness Movement and PHM Token, and our other spin-off platforms we will be bringing together teams of approximately 30 skilled and talented professionals, with a focus on marketing and social media. The hacks will be 1 week long and held in beautiful venues where we will split time between pushing each platform and token out to the world, and partying. This approach allows us to attract skilled people who want to be around others who are passionate about creating positive change and want to have fun while doing it. 

Rewarding their efforts at the hack with the tokens they are working on creates buy-in to the community and ensures the key people setting the vibe at the beginning are pro-active, kind hearted, and understand the need to make creating change fun.

Two of the spin-off platforms and tokens will launch before our meta Public Happiness Movement platform and token. This way we can show the world what we can build and its power to create positive change before launching the meta hub where we build projects. When Public Happiness Movement launches we will be able to answer the question 'how do we know it'll work' by showing the projects already built, already working and having an impact on key issues troubling humanity and our planet. 

Each will launch with two initial week-long Launch Party Hacks, with the possibility to repeat these as often as is beneficial.

**Bus Tour**
A team of our community will be touring in a bus/minibuses and taking the Public Happiness Movement and Token to the streets. Initially beginning with Europe. Other prominent groups on the platform may be invited to tour their continent, mirroring the main tour groups actions and structure. The buses will also aim to attend and create a human, communities and planet focused sideshow at all major fin-tech events creating portable event spaces with our own vision aligned speakers and events - for more details see section 9.5.


Towns, cities and villages:
On the tour the team will visit cities, towns and villages and demonstrate how people can earn a Public Happiness Token and what impact it can have on life in their local community. 

Community members chosen for the bus tours will use their skills to target local issues with positive action in the places we visit, in partnership with local groups/charities. Issues like homelessness, loneliness, supporting the elderly, lack of urban green areas and gardens. Alongside our general Public Happiness activities.

Conferences, Festivals, and Happiness Economy Events:
We will be touring blockchain/fin-tech conferences, festivals, and happiness related events. The bus will carry equipment and team members to create exciting activities and flash-mob style entertainment at these events. Both officially and unofficially. It will also serve as an office, meeting space, and sleeping rooms will often be available to select partners.

Green Fuel:
[Connie the Connector](https://www.facebook.com/connietheconnector/) was converted by Andy and another community member in 2014 to switch back and forth between regular Diesel and running on Waste Vegetable Oil - leftover cooking oil (WVO). At the time it was carbon positive travel as the cooking oil needed to be disposed of. Whilst this is rarely true now as most used cooking oil is collected by large biodiesel companies, it is arguably still the greenest form of fuelling a vehicle and older diesel buses will require minimal conversions to run on it. Partnerships with hotel and restaurant chains will be sought to see if its possible to run our bus fleet on the oil thrown out by their kitchens.

Taken from each YouTube play-lists related category on our platform (unless the creator has added their own video). 

Combined with our coordinated hash-tagging this will provide a huge boost across standard social media; both for our community, and also for each group that is a part of our ecosystem.

The bus tour will also be filmed, with regular instalments of life on the road taking Public Happiness and our token into local communities and bringing more happiness and well-being to the world. As a ground-breaking and exciting project we anticipate attracting a large following, especially as it will be supported by all other marketing efforts.

## Happier World Economies Summit

An alternative global economic Summit hosted by Focallocal in Davos at the same time as The World Economic Forum. Combining industry leaders in the Public Happiness world, with Economic leaders exploring new economic systems which place people, communities and our planet; rightfully as the most important metric and goal to base the success of our societies on. 

A Summit where solutions will emerge to refocus our global and local economies on incentivising many more people in each community to take regular positive action with their neighbours to resolve any and all issues reducing well-being where they live. The goal is empowering people and communities, all of us, to take ownership for the well-being of our local community and everyone in it. Industry leaders will be invited to discuss, design and grow the economic systems needed to scale projects and make have out-sized, and dramatic impacts on improving societal and mental health worldwide through implementing new economic systems - like the Public Happiness Token, which will be launching at the Summit.

We will create a 'lean in' and bottom up Summit, where attendees are invited to bring their skills and experience, and apply them to challenges threaded into the event to create real world outcomes which are immediately actionable by local people in the communities where they live.

**Slides currently under construction**

## Slide 1: What is the problem?

Today's irresponsible economic model is destroying the earth and perpetuating human suffering. GDP based capitalism has lifted many out of poverty, but in its current form it will never solve poverty, or many of the issues caused by poverty.

## Slide 2: Where is the problem?

The World Economic Forum brings together the leaders of the economic world. A world which is heavily focused on top-down economic discussion, and heavily locked into the current GDP based system which is failing to produce healthy, happy societies. Now is the time to explore new economic systems, and we need to create a space at the world's leading economic summit for those creating radical forward thinking economic solutions which empower humanity to solve the many societal issues reducing well-being and damaging our communities and planet. 

## Slide 3: What is the solution?

The Happier World Economies Summit
(slide shows logo which features an upwards arrow and 'People, Communities and Planet' written in a heart shaped earth between 'Happier' and 'World'.

## Slide 4: Our Summit

The Happier World Economies Summit combines: 

- the best ideas engaging people and communities in tackling societal issues, and creating more peace and well-being where they live. 
- with the economic experts, society and thought leaders, especially those interested in creating new economic systems focused on people, communities and the planet ahead of profits. 

The Summit's is focused on bottom-up grass-roots action, and 'how can we create economic systems to better support these empowering ideas to build a brighter future for humanity'

## Slide 5: Overview

The summit will reach out to everyone interested beforehand and invite them to participate in suggesting and voting for the events, projects, ideas and speakers which they want to attend during our Summit (who fit with our criteria). Our Summit will then host those which receive the most votes at venues across Davos and Klosters, matching money raised from sponsors with the costs of each top voted project. An open invite is sent out for anyone to find a sponsor, in exchange for a finders fee.

## Slide 6: Why Should Stakeholders Join In?

**Investors:** 
Increased exposure: We engage a wide audience to make sure the most impactful ideas are presented at, and alongside, the World's leading yearly economic event. The voting phase for their funding spots will bring a lot more attention to their company/group (if desired), than standard sponsorship deals where sponsors are often reduced to a few logos and thank you messages - which most people ignore. 

Increased real-world impact: All attendees at the events they sponsor, in planning real world projects on our platform which target the issues they want to fund solutions to. The event then becomes a staging point where action is initiated, and sponsors can follow (and further support) the projects which will have the biggest impact on each issue they chose to fund, which are voted on, funded using our token, and built by our global community - a model which is far more economical than other existing models.

Many events and projects on our platform will be targeting SDG issues. we give these an easy to see badge stating on our platform so people can see at a glance which issue is being targeted. This opens up funding from SDG pools. We chose not to limit our actions to just SDG challenges, as there are many important areas for improving the health of humanity's socieites which would be excluded.

**W.E.F Attendees:**
Many will choose to come and join what we're doing because the concept resonates with them of guiding events in Davos during the week, and thereby the economic world, down a path which prioritises people, communities and our planet; is a change which humanity needs to see. 

Others will join in because they enjoy being engaged in choosing the Summit's program, designing real world solutions during it and the idea that those ideas will be created and make a change in the world. Many will come because the vibrant, positive and fun energy coming from our Summit is attractive and refreshing, so they naturally are pulled in to see what we're building.

Fun: Our Summit will feature exhilarating and enjoyable events, like public dance parties,  because creating change is easier when its fun. 

**Speakers, Organisers and Events:**
It's a new way to get onto the program at a high profile global event, and one which usually wouldn't have space for their messages and vision, because, although they sometimes overlap, there is a big difference between events grounded in GDP economics, and those grounded in benefiting people, communities and the planet.


**Venues:**
Our flexible model adapts around their schedule so any available time slots at a venue can be filled, drawing a crowd to their venue. This will be especially effective for those a little off the main street who much of the WEF crowds pass by. 

We also believe the message will resonate with many organisers as its something different and interesting, with a potential to create rapid real world changes at a local level.


**unDavos**
The main counter-culture social group set up to attract disruptive and alternative ideas and change makers. Our message is in-line with a significant portion of their aims, and we hope to foster a good relationship and become a central part of their community and mission.

## Slide 7: Criteria

Focus: 

- Fantastic ideas, communities and projects for bringing more peace and well-being to people, communities and the planet.
- Economic solutions to support these ideas, and economists calling for them.
- A bottom up summit: Events should focus on how these ideas are actionable by local people at a grass-roots level, and have an impact daily lives in communities around the world


Themes for each day: 
- 1: Personal Growth
- 2: Community Connection
- 3: Innovative Economic Systems 
- 4: Environment and Sustainability
- 5: Art, Dance, Music and Poetry
- 6: Anything else. Mix it up!

Underlying Question: 
How can we build economic systems to support these better, and allow everyone in the world to be rewarded for benefiting the community in one of these categories.

Question for all attendees during the Summit: 
Suggest, discuss, collaborate and vote on new projects and ideas in our platform. The top ideas will be built after the summit by The Public Happiness Community using our unique system (and everyone is invited to join in the build process). This is how we demonstrate the difference our token, platform and community can create in the world. 

## Slide 8: Pre-Summit Selecting Events

Events to be hosted at Davos are suggested, discussed and voted on by those attending. This will include speakers, panels, workshops. This engages a wide audience in helping to publicise our Happier World Economies Summit and boosts the interest behind each event, and the project as a whole. The original suggester will also suggest/update a budget and equipment required to deliver it.

Available venues are placed on our maps and calendar so projects can aim for specific slots. 

Funding Pools are collected in each category. Allowing funders to target specific issues and so users can see where funding is available and shape their project ideas to target it.

Project ideas state their requirements in the project plan and facilities needed for it (square foot, equipment, required theme, cost).

On set dates, the highest voted events are offered the 1st pick of available venues and matched by our team with funding available for the topic of their event.


If they decide to accept then their event is moved from the suggestion, voting and comment section (Global) into the map (Local) section and added to the calendar of events occurring under the Happier World Economies Summit banner, where attendees can search sign up, and begin (/continue) talking chatting and engaging with each other and the creator.

## Slide 9: Funding and Venues

An open invite is put out for anyone to join in and participate in finding sponsors for the Summit, by offering a 10% finders fee. 

Anyone who wants to support a progressive humanistic and environmental economic agenda at the Summit is also welcome to donate directly via crowd funding.

Venue's are approached to join in and become a part of the Summit by offering a space at any time during W.E.F

80% of donations goes to the project, with 20% going to support the Summit's wider vision, help cover operational costs, and create a bigger follow up Happier World Economies Summit later in the year. 

The events are run on a 'pay what you feel its worth to you model', mostly because people have a tendency to value things which are free lower than things which are paid, so this is avoiding that 'cheap' feeling, whilst also providing an extra source of income. 50% of money received at the gate will go towards improving the next Happier World Economies Summit, and 50% will go to the event organiser. 

## Slide 10: Example
- 10k funding is offered for sustainability projects at W.E.F and goes into a card on the platform.
- A venue offers 30 square meters between 14:00 - 18:00 for 8k. This goes into a card on the platform.
- Briana sees the funding pool and decides to design an environmental round table on things local communities can do to mitigate climate change, to match it. 
- At 'voting deadline #2' Briana's event is ranked 1st by community voting
- Briana's event wins nomination, she receives funding for her project, and has 1st pick of locations available.

## Slide 11: Buses!

Our fleet of modified buses will provide novel and mobile event venues, and also provide sleeping space in the evenings for many of the nominated events and speakers who aren't able to find affordable accommodation near Davos and would otherwise be excluded.

The bus fleet will then travel to all major fin-tech and economic events in and near Europe, creating a 'people, communities and planet' supplementary add-on summit.


## Slide 12: Attendees During the Summit

After pre-Summit voting is finishes new funding pools will be created from the Public Happiness Token and the discussion and voting will revert to our normal model of projects which empower local people and communities to tackle societal issues, and create more well-being in the world 

Sponsors, companies and philanthropists can still donate to create extra specialised funding pools (see our whitepaper for more info)

All attendees at the Summit will be engaged in suggesting, discussing, collaborating and voting on new projects to empower local people and communities to create more peace and well-being in the world around them on the Public Happiness Movement platform which will be built by our global community, who are rewarded in The Public Happiness Token.

## Slide 13: Real World Outcomes After the Summit

The highest voted ideas for empowering local communities to tackle societal issues and create more well-being and peace where they live, are now moved into the build list on the Public Happiness Movement platform, and will be created by our global community who are incentivised by earning Public Happiness Tokens, to ensure real world impact in the daily lives of people around the world. 

This process will be boosted with a Societal Good Hackathon hosted in Davos immediately after WEF week. Teams will be invited to come in to build the top voted ideas suggested by attendees during our Summit, so everyone who attended our Happier World Economies Summit can see significant instant action on delivering their favourite suggestions to the world.

This will include economic models and specific actions, on both local and global levels. All actions must be implemented by local people as the underlying aim is empowering individuals and communities, rather than solving their problems for them. 

## Slide 14: Token Launch
All attendees who contribute to discussing and voting on real-world projects which can be built after the Summit, will be rewarded in The Public Happiness Token, which will be launching at the platform. This demonstrates how the token can be used to create and deliver creative projects to better humanity.

## Questions:
- We need something more firm than just having the platform to engage people in discussing and suggesting new ideas. There should be some kind of pull system supporting the platforms mechanism of creating post Summit activities.

**Public Happiness Partners and Pre-existing Communities**
There is already a global Movement of Public Happiness creators around the World. Our platform creates a space for the individual energy of all our communities to unite, exponentially magnifying the energy of each, and their impact on the world. The difficulties of balancing committing the time needed to manage and grow their community, against the pressures of needing to be paid for their work in today’s economy, which doesn't financially value those contributions.

Founder Andy has been a professional Public Happiness creator for the past 7 years and is well connected to the most active in the Public Happiness industry. A few select leaders will be offered ‘back-pay’ for their previous unrewarded contributions towards creating a kinder world for us all to live in, this also acts as an encouragement to join our ecosystem. Using the platform offers them more effective tools to pursue their vision. As high ranking members in our reputation system due to their past works, they'll also have a greater influence over shaping those tools to fit their needs. Our new economy, provides a fair reward for their efforts to benefit others lives in society. The tokenised system is designed to reduce, or even remove, the current heavy financial pressures to stop doing their excellent work for humanity. 

The existing leaders of the Movement would then become leaders on our platform, due to their pre-earned reputation. Granting the ability to direct the new platform and communities evolution, protecting the vision of the Movement they founded and guiding the development of ever more effective tools to manage their communities and advance their mission. Their existing community retains its individual identity on our platform, having its own page with forums, photos, videos, external links to their existing online hubs, tools to guide community members desired actions, and group hash-tag. 

Our ecosystem makes it far easier for new groups to form and grow. They will instantly have access to a wide audience to join in their activities - organic reach which has become increasingly difficult on established social media platforms with the shift towards 'pay-to-play' models.

On-boarding existing communities is extremely easy and effective. There are millions around the world already joining in these Public Happiness activities using the blunt traditional social media platforms. We just advise them to withhold the meeting point on those platforms and tell users to join The Public Happiness Platform to find it (along with reasons why). This leads to a near 100% conversion of this community into platform users, where the site is set up to help them participate in that community, rather than to minimise their engagement and maximise clicks. Where they can begin learning about blockchain basics, and earning a token. Where they also become part of a wider and truly global Movement.

You can read further details about existing partners in section 5.4.


If comfortable operating within our [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844), new groups operating for similar goals will be invited to join our ecosystem. Massively boost their growth and good work through our enhanced network effect, while also retaining their identity.

**Online Supporters**
An open community is active on Reddit at reddit.com/r/tokenisinghappiness where people can interact with other supporters of the project. Our internal community will communicate through our integrated Discourse forum on our platform, creating different levels and a space for both close supporters and a wider circle for the public who are following.

Members of our core team interested in public interaction will aim to engage blockchain enthusiasts on other popular online forums, for example, r/ethereum and r/cryptocurrency. Our aim is to seek feedback and involve existing communities in the building process, rather than to build hype and push marketing information out. 

The former approach brings valuable feedback and criticism from knowledgeable hobbyists, shining a light on areas which need improving. Building a genuine relationship by taking an interest in their views.

The latter is simply a cheap marketing exercise which has been saturated by the deluge of new projects last year. It would likely lead to excess cynicism.

## 9.13. 

**Paid to Party**

A series of high energy clubs and parties organised by experienced party creators around the world, chosen because their usual offerings embody the positive and creative spirit we wish to create with the Public Happiness Token. These events will be branded 'Paid to Party' because community members will be investing in our Token, rather than buying tickets. The tickets will be given free along with their token purchase at an amount of tokens estimated to be slightly above equivalent to the value of the tickets after 6 months (emphasis on the estimation will be avoided as it's very difficult to accurately determine the value of 1 token in 6 months time). 

Party goers will be given the option to invest more while buying (investing in) the tickets, and guided into joining our platform and community. Token's given away during this can be considered to be akin to a standard air-drop, except far more effective in on-boarding and engaging a wider audience.

This approach has the following benefits: 

1) We create another path to reach audiences outside of the normal crypto-world's audience

2) It's a fantastic way of bringing people into the platform, raising awareness, and setting the positive and energetic atmosphere we want to perpetuate

3) Our platform and token become linked with an excellent experience, and we gather thousands more community members who are now curious about their investment in The Public Happiness Token

The Token Price will initially reflect the amount raised in the Initial Coin Offerings. Following on, the ecosystem will have financial (Fiat) feed-in streams to continually grow our economy. The stronger our economy becomes, the means more power to all of the functions we exist to faciliatate in the world. Also allowing us to cover:
* operating costs 
* supporting the team during the initial growth phase 
* marketing campaigns until we are strong enough to run them all internally

There will also be a pool created for the community to use. Members will vote on how they wish to assign it in order to create maximum value to the ecosystem. This might include: 
* buying back and burning tokens to raise their price
* outsourcing a much desired feature or task we currently lack the capacity to create internally
* supporting a project being built in the which members believe can deliver great impact with a cash injection
* donating to an external worthy cause

**Speculation**

Speculation on exchanges is the main way the token's value will rise. Many people will want to add it to their portfolio to support the great work they see being done for well-being and peace in the world, or just because one of our members made their grandmothers day with a kind act and she's still smiling. Others will want to invest expecting the price to rise as awareness grows, followed by increasing demand for our token. Our strategy is to focus mainly on Decentralised Exchanges, and point of sale hot swapping.

Being listed on at least one trust-worthy exchange before our IEO's finish is important to have a simple way users can begin trading the token immediately.

**Local Happiness Hubs**

Local Happiness Hubs are like gyms, except instead of lifting weights or jumping on a treadmill you will drop in to exercise your happiness and well-being. 
 
They operate outside of our economic system and feed in to it, just like a gym members pay a monthly fee and receive access to all the activities, courses, and equipment available to improve their well-being.
 
The hubs operate as franchises giving us access to global markets, and the ability to onboard existing community centers, and buildings that have regular empty space, who want to join the scheme and movement. Finances need to be assessed in more detail, but a rough estimate would be that we take 6% of the total income from monthly subscriptions, and allow the franchisee to set prices that fit their local area.
 
The hubs use the systems already built into our platform so that users can choose by voting what activities will be conducted in the space each month to create their own schedule and taylor our community hub to their needs. The platform allows users to suggest new ideas which if approved by the wider community to meet our community vision and values, will then go into the suggestions page for other hubs members to see and suggest at their local Happiness Hub.
 
An example of activities on offer:
 
- A pillow fight work-out class
- Morning dance parties
- Group life goals setting and support meetings
- Habit forming workshops
- A compliments circle where people take turns to be in the middle
- A Nerf gun battle
- Training courses on improving your well-being and happiness like the free Yale online course
- A massage circle
- Community benefiting projects planning sessions
- Art therapy
- Youtube based ‘learn a new skill’ sessions

The platform includes a store where community members submit designs for, and purchase, clothing and Public Happiness supplies. 'Active Happiness Clothing' means that the designs manifest positive things to happen around the wearer, and so it is an extension of our Public Happiness Activities. For example, a tee that invites passers-by to share one minute of eye contact with the person wearing it, to explore human connection together.

**Corporate Social Responsibility**

Corporates and local businesses are all looking for ways to positively impact the world, and local communities they operate in to meet their CSR commitments. Our platform is absolutely ideal for this purpose as they can offer a set amount of funding to local people to target a specific issue, or one of their own choosing, in a creative and fun way. They can then map progress and results the entire way through via our platform and social media. 

Companies, and philanthropists can create bounties to target a local, or global in our platform. These challenges go into our Global section to be solved as standard - the community suggest ideas, vote on one, then come together to deliver it. The reward goes into our community fund where the best way to use it to advance the mission will be chosen, and tokens equal to the reward split fairly between everyone who joined in, based on their contribution.

If the project is realised in the physical world (as most will be) experiences of the day are gathered for those who put forward the funding for the challenge via one or two extra hashtags, suggested by the funders, to enable them to piggy-back on our networks enhanced social media effect, to gain exposure for the excellent project which they supported and enabled with their kind offer. 

Running CSR through our platform creates an entire story of their for them, their stakeholders and staff to follow. This story also leaves a permanent trail for those curious or grateful in the local communities affected by the project they funded. If good-will or marketing was their aim, the story we create has a long legacy. This CSR route has the potential to be lucrative, boosting the tokens price and market value rapidly. Its also providing a regular boost for us to reach, engage with local communities, and further achieve our mission.

The platform also allows for community members to suggest and create their own creative fund-raising projects, as long as they also fit with our [Community Values](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2844) statement. This doesn't mean standard fund-raising like asking for sponsors to do a sky-dive. It's for creative innovative projects which also bring happiness directly while raising funds, for example [Queue Pimping](https://publichappinessmovement.com/docuss/build). Keeping balance to prevent fund-raising projects taking too much energy away from community projects is a challenge which the early community will be presented with as it grapples with decentralised decision making and taking on ownership for the direction we grow in.

        code: "WeiMin",
        fullText: `

## 12.1.

**Weighted Mining**
Levels of trust:
Community members will go up in ranks as their total contribution to global happiness increases through our platform. Each rank receives more tokens for each action on the platform. This reduces the incentive for scamming by making it less rewarding to automate new accounts. It also rewards the most active and loyal contributors to the ecosystem and the global Public Happiness Movement.


Levels of Scale:
Some local activities are organised on an International Scale as a coordinated effort to create positive cultural change. Peter Sharp at the Liberators International, for example, organises a yearly Eye Contact Gathering promoting increased human and societal connection through sharing a minute of eye contact with passers-by. To remind us of our shared human experience beyond superficial differences such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc. Last year on one day he mobilised a gathering in over 350 cities around the world. Bringing action to the streets for more connected communities at a local level, while targeting a global increase in well-being. 

When an activity is tiered in this manner on our site over the course of a few days, the original organiser will receive 20% of the tokens awarded to all the Public Happiness Activities they led and supported. Their core team will also receive a larger share of tokens if they are using the Action Center in our ecosystem to incentivise building and publicising the project.

[List of participating cities](https://www.eyecontactexperiment.com/participating-countries) for the 2017 International Eye Contact Experience for Human Connection.

Levels of average cost of living in each country: 
The token earnings from creating activities or completing project missions will be linked to the current average income in each country, keeping a balanced incentive to join the project across every nation. Taken from a publicly available online source of average cost of living per country. 

In special occasions the community may choose to vote on increasing the incentive in a specific country above its cost of living, for example, to offer support during hyperinflation, such as Venezuela has recently been experiencing; and other situations where increased community connection is of significant urgency. Or perhaps simply to target a country where few people have joined.

Obviously allowing the community to vote on increasing a regions token rewards, creates an avenue for potential voting abuse and will need to be monitored rigorously, until our community'd self-governance is mature and thoroughly pressure tested.


Experience Multipliers:
A users total tokens earned/contribution to the ecosystem is recorded and used as a multiplier increasing their tokens earned and also the weight of their votes.

* Beginner Happiness Maker

* Novice Well-being Creator

* Experienced Positivity Activist

* Local  Action Hero

* Public Happiness Legend

By backdating the tokens awarded based on a members previous contributions to humanity through their public happiness endevours, we create a system where experienced community leaders instantly become the leaders of our ecosystem. By having only 5 levels we can create a system where everyone can become a leader within our ecosystem, keeping it within reach of all members once they have contributed enough to understand the culture and values which drive our mission.

## 12.2.

**Hard Cap**
A hard cap will be set on the amount that any one user can earn each reward period, at each different user level. Minimising the risk from abuse and fraud, and maintaining our core vision of Public Happiness Token allowing community members increased economic freedom to give their time to resolving local societal issues, and increasing community connection and well-being. The hard cap will be a percentage of the tokens released in that period, modified as the user base increases. 

For example, 80% of all tokens in that period might be reasonable when there are 100 active users, but would be unfair and likely indicate a loophole in the system, when there are 100,000 active users.

The percentage earned from each sub-activity when coordinating large scale activities and projects is subject to a different hard cap limit for tokens earned, as it could feasibly be a significant percent of all work ecosystem-wide, when a coordinated global activity occurs. Any obscenely large reward will likely be flagged for discussion by the community to check for abuse, or corrections needed in our systems.

40% will be retained in our cold storage vault. Released to users ‘mining’ by creating Public Happiness activities/projects, and doing essential work in the ecosystem.

Initial targeted release time: 100 years 

The mining total will include a small amount that will be ‘back-paid’ to notable communities around the world. Those who have given their time to create Public Happiness projects which fit within the Movements shared mission, as a thank you for their efforts, and in order to encourage them to use our platform to increase their network effect. This will also include volunteers who gave their time and energy to building the Public Happiness Movement community, never expecting to be reimbursed for their efforts.

**Further Matrix Considerations**
The matrix needs to consider: 
The number of active users each week, from 10 to 100,000 to 100,000,000
The number of actions per week by a user, plotted between 1, to a high of 400. With the average per user anticipated to be around 20, multiplied by the users experience rating. 

Estimating the value of returns is speculative at this point. The core team, and later the community itself, will adjust the points ‘mined’ for each action. As governance progresses on the path to decentralisation, these charts will be interactive and hosted on the platform as a useful visual guide to voting on increasing/decreasing these data points, and maximising their impact in advancing and maintaining the mission.

## 15.1.

**Huge Market Crash**
Public Happiness Token is entirely secure from some major news crashing investors confidence in the entire blockchain, or global economic markets. Everything is designed with the ability to fall away, with the platform and community capable of running a skeleton site.

We achieve this important safety buffer by transferring agreed fees and payments into a separate bank account and crypto wallets as soon as an outgoing can be predicted, so that money is put at the moment we assessed that it was a good use of funds. Preferring short term contracts as a project policy, meaning all future costs are safely stored away and ready to be paid when agreed. 

The platform could in theory continue operating in a self-sustaining mode in the future, with absolutely zero outgoings, if we collectively decide to switch to running on the Dapps network.

The project already has 7 years of experience demonstrating that people believe in our vision and will continue to use the platform regardless of the value of the Token. Even in the case of a complete market crash where the token became almost worthless for a prolonged period, many community members would remain active supporting the mission, and using the platform to deliver greater peace and well-being to the world. 

Public Happiness Token would basically become fancy internet points, with the added benefit that the loyal members, and those giving their time and energy to global happiness purely for altruistic reasons, would get to stock up on token and be handsomely rewarded when it rises from the embers of the market crash. 

As long as there is a positive community behind it the Token cannot fail. It will continue to be a positive force in this world regardless of Market conditions.

**Quantum Security**
To some extent we are tied to advancements in the Ethereum network. There are open pull requests such as pull request #208: Abstraction of transaction origin and signature.md. 

On our end our entire system is being reviewed by quantum security experts. We will also host bounties and bounty hunting contests for anyone able to find flaws and vulnerabilities in our platform, so they can be identified and fixed. As much of the platform as possible will be open source, to benefit from many eyes searching for and flagging vulnerabilities.

**Massive Hack**
As a last resort in the case of a massive attack there is the possibility of a Hard Fork, resetting everything to a time before the hack on the public ledger.

Our Tokens value is tied to its positive effect on wider society, raising the possibility of a hard fork at a set point before the hack, and switching the token used on the platform; isolated from its ability to create societal good the original would become worthless.

All data of tokens earned on the system is held off-site in social media and gathered by our bots, or in provable work contributed by community members in the Action Center, Community News Site and Forums. It would be a large task, but all tokens mined fairly between the time of the hack and the fork could be restored. Traded Tokens (outside of lost in the hack) would be visible on the public ledger and proof of ownership could be submitted to gain the new Token. 

Project contributions in Wekan/Trello can be backed up off-site or recovered from the teams which created the projects. Token earned legitimately after the hack could easily be restored, leaving the thieves with worthless digital residue. 

The implications of this option are obviously wide ranging and it would be an absolute last resort in a disaster mitigation strategy, with the case explained to the community before being voted on.

**Zombie Apocalypse**
If the inevitable finally occurs, we will convert the Public Happiness Bus into a ‘Public Happiness Buoat’ and retreat to a small uninhabited Greek island, where our new society will flourish and sparkle as a bastion to all Humanity's greatest achievements. Using Public Happiness Token to create a paradise where every economic interaction creates more harmony and a closer more caring community, while the rest of the world performs a perfect impression of today’s paparazzi for each others brains. 

If the community has decided on having a fixed central base, for example renovating an abandoned village, it will be built using the best off-grid technology today’s society has to offer - and also be zombie-proofed.

2% of all funds we raise from the IEO will be donated to support the Open-source ecosystem that drives so much of the innovation we see in the world


## 16.1.

**Open Source Projects We Use**
* Discourse

* Plug-ins our platform uses

* Click the balloon here to discuss others we should support


## 16.2.

**Donations to Notable Other Open-source Projects**
1% of the total raised will be donated to other notable open-source projects which are positive forces within this world, as chosen by our community through voting during the IEO, for example, Wikipedia, and Libre Office 

The vote results will be non-binding, to allow mitigation against any uncovered attempts to cheat the vote by outside groups. The platform and community will not yet be ready to protect itself from coordinated subversion efforts, without spending excess amounts of energy on securing the voting. Instead it can be used as an early pressure test on the integrity of certain areas of the platform, as this type of online contest invariably draws efforts to undermine fair voting.

* 1st draft of the White Paper created by founder
* Experts invited to review and advise on improvements
*  2nd draft of the White Paper
* A team of experts wanting to see this ecosystem brought into this world forms
* Witticism, fun and Focallocal flavour added to white paper
* Provisional White Paper posted online to announce our token, and gather feedback for further improvements, and build team. 
* Technical Details focused heavily around the Distribution Matrix added to the white paper
* IEO Launch date announced
Still to plan:
* 1st Stage IEO
* 2nd Stage IEO
* 3rd Stage IEO
* Apps launched
* Multi Language adaptation pushed to the entire site
* Open-source map replaces Google based map (if required)
* blockchain on-ramp added into it platform to guide community members to a better understanding of blockchain and crypto economics. Fulfilling our mission of taking crypto to people on the streets.

* Open-sourcing. The vast majority of the system will be open-sourced 6 months after launch. We need to determine any sections which are too sensitive to open-source.
* Getting listed on centralised and decentralised exchanges. The token will always have a low value if people can’t trade it so we’ll need to be listed on a few before the IEO finishes
* Which other crypto coins/tokens should we include in the platform to introduce our community members into the crypto-economic ecosystem, for example, should our videos primarily be  hosted on Lbury? Is their platform ready?
* Should the platform be hosted on the DAPPs network?
* Should community governance voting be tokenized/on-chain? Or simply by using Discourse’s forum voting? Either would involve building a discourse plug-in 
* How can we best compartmentalise voting to prevent overload on community members, without pockets of influence forming? 
Next Steps:
* Set up IEO plan within our Action Center
* Full review of all content on news.publichappinessmovement.com to update content that has become outdated
* Token created
* Full security review of all open-source plug-ins used in building the website
* Full review of platform UX/UI and tech stack, looking quick ways to make large usability improvements, improving access and scalability.
Thank you for reading, have a wonderful day!
